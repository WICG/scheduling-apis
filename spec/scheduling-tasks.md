Scheduling Tasks {#sec-scheduling-tasks}
=====================

Task Priorities {#sec-task-priorities}
---------------------

This spec formalizes three priorities to support scheduling tasks:

<pre class='idl'>
  enum TaskPriority {
    "user-blocking",
    "user-visible",
    "background"
  };
</pre>

<dfn enum-value for=TaskPriority>user-blocking</dfn> is the highest priority,
and is meant to be used for tasks that are blocking the user's ability to
interact with the page, such as rendering the core experience or responding to
user input.

<dfn enum-value for=TaskPriority>user-visible</dfn> is the second highest
priority, and is meant to be used for tasks that visible to the user but not
necessarily blocking user actions, such as rendering secondary parts of the
page. This is the default priority.

<dfn enum-value for=TaskPriority>background</dfn> is the lowest priority, and
is meant to be used for tasks that are not time-critical, such as background
log processing or initializing certain third party libraries.

Note: Tasks scheduled through a given {{Scheduler}} run in *strict priority
order*, meaning the scheduler will always run "{{TaskPriority/user-blocking}}"
tasks before "{{TaskPriority/user-visible}}" tasks, which in turn always run
before "{{TaskPriority/background}}" tasks.

<div algorithm>
  {{TaskPriority}} |p1| is <dfn for="TaskPriority">less than</dfn>
  {{TaskPriority}} |p2| if |p1| is less than |p2| in the
  following total ordering:
  "{{TaskPriority/background}}" < "{{TaskPriority/user-visible}}" < "{{TaskPriority/user-blocking}}"
</div>


The `Scheduler` Interface {#sec-scheduler}
---------------------

<xmp class='idl'>
  dictionary SchedulerPostTaskOptions {
    AbortSignal signal;
    TaskPriority priority;
    [EnforceRange] unsigned long long delay = 0;
  };

  callback SchedulerPostTaskCallback = any ();

  [Exposed=(Window, Worker)]
  interface Scheduler {
    Promise<any> postTask(SchedulerPostTaskCallback callback,
                          optional SchedulerPostTaskOptions options = {});
  };
</xmp>

Note: The {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}} option can be either an
{{AbortSignal}} or a {{TaskSignal}}, but is defined as an {{AbortSignal}} since
it is a superclass of {{TaskSignal}}. For cases where the priority might
change, a {{TaskSignal}} is needed. But for cases where only cancellation is
needed, an {{AbortSignal}} would suffice, potentially making it easier to
integrate the API into existing code that uses {{AbortSignal|AbortSignals}}.

<dl class="domintro non-normative">
  <dt><code>result = scheduler . {{Scheduler/postTask()|postTask}}( |callback|, |options| )</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns a promise that is fulfilled with the return value of |callback|,
    or rejected with the {{AbortSignal}}'s [=AbortSignal/abort reason=] if the
    task is aborted. If |callback| throws an error during execution, the promise
    returned by {{Scheduler/postTask()}} will be rejected with that error.

    <p>The task's {{TaskPriority|priority}} is determined by the combination of
    |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/priority}} and
    {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}}:

    <ul>
      <li>If |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/priority}} is specified, then
      that {{TaskPriority}} will be used to schedule the task, and the task's
      priority is immutable.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, if |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}} is
      specified and is a {{TaskSignal}} object, then the task's priority is
      determined by |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}}'s
      [=TaskSignal/priority=]. In this case the task's priority is *dynamic*,
      and can be changed by calling {{TaskController/setPriority()|controller.setPriority()}}
      for the associated {{TaskController}}.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, the task's priority defaults to "{{TaskPriority/user-visible}}".</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>If |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}} is specified, then the
    {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}} is used by the {{Scheduler}} to
    determine if the task is aborted.

    <p>If |option|'s {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/delay}} is specified and greater
    than 0, then the execution of the task will be delayed for at least
    {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/delay}} milliseconds.
  </dd>
</dl>


A {{Scheduler}} object has an associated <dfn for="Scheduler">static priority task queue map</dfn>,
which is a [=map=] from {{TaskPriority}} to [=scheduler task queue=]. This map
is initialized to a new empty [=map=].

A {{Scheduler}} object has an associated <dfn for="Scheduler">dynamic priority task queue map</dfn>,
which is a [=map=] from {{TaskSignal}} to [=scheduler task queue=]. This map is
initialized to a new empty [=map=].

Note: We implement *dynamic prioritization* by enqueuing tasks associated with
a specific {{TaskSignal}} into the same [=scheduler task queue=], and changing
that queue's priority in response to `prioritychange` events. The
[=Scheduler/dynamic priority task queue map=] holds the
[=scheduler task queues=] whose priorities can change, and the map key is the
{{TaskSignal}} which all tasks in the queue are associated with.
<br/></br>
The values of the [=Scheduler/static priority task queue map=] are
[=scheduler task queues=] whose priorities do not change. Tasks with *static
priorities* &mdash; those that were scheduled with an explicit
{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/priority}} option or a
{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}} option that is null or is an {{AbortSignal}}
&mdash; are placed in these queues, based on {{TaskPriority}}, which is the
key for the map.
<br/><br/>
An alternative, and logicially equivalent implementation, would be to maintain a
single per-{{TaskPriority}} [=scheduler task queue=], and move tasks between
[=scheduler task queues=] in response to a {{TaskSignal}}'s
[=TaskSignal/priority=] changing, inserting based on
[=scheduler task/enqueue order=]. This approach would simplify
[=selecting the task queue of the next scheduler task=], but make priority
changes more complex.


A {{Scheduler}} object has a numeric <dfn for="Scheduler">next enqueue order</dfn>
which is initialized to 1.

Note: The [=Scheduler/next enqueue order=] is a strictly increasing number that
is used to determine task execution order across [=scheduler task queues=] of the
same {{TaskPriority}} within the same {{Scheduler}}. A logically equivalent
alternative would be to place the [=Scheduler/next enqueue order=] on the
[=event loop=], since the only requirements are that the number be strictly
increasing and not be repeated within a {{Scheduler}}.

Issue: Would it be simpler to just use a timestamp here?

The <dfn method for=Scheduler title="postTask(callback, options)">postTask(|callback|, |options|)</dfn>
method steps are to return the result of [=scheduling a postTask task=] for [=this=]
given |callback| and |options|.


Definitions {#sec-scheduling-tasks-definitions}
---------------------

A <dfn>scheduler task</dfn> is a [=/task=] with an additional numeric
<dfn for="scheduler task">enqueue order</dfn> [=struct/item=], initially set to 0.

A [=scheduler task=] |t1| is <dfn for="scheduler task">older than</dfn>
[=scheduler task=] |t2| if |t1|'s [=scheduler task/enqueue order=] less than |t2|'s
[=scheduler task/enqueue order=].

<br/>

The following [=task sources=] are defined as <dfn>scheduler task sources</dfn>,
and must only be used for [=scheduler tasks=].

: <dfn>The posted task task source</dfn>
:: This [=task source=] is used for tasks scheduled through {{Scheduler/postTask()}}.

<br/>

A <dfn>scheduler task queue</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following [=struct/items=]:

: <dfn for="scheduler task queue">priority</dfn>
:: A {{TaskPriority}}.
: <dfn for="scheduler task queue">tasks</dfn>
:: A [=set=] of [=scheduler tasks=].

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn lt="create a scheduler task queue|creating a scheduler task queue">create a scheduler task queue</dfn>
  with {{TaskPriority}} |priority|:

  1. Let |queue| be a new [=scheduler task queue=].
  1. Set |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/priority=] to |priority|.
  1. Set |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/tasks=] to a new empty [=set=].
  1. Return |queue|.
</div>

A [=scheduler task queue=] |queue|'s <dfn for="scheduler task queue">first runnable task</dfn>
is the first [=scheduler task=] in |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/tasks=] that is
[=task/runnable=].

Processing Model {#sec-scheduling-tasks-processing-model}
---------------------

### Queueing and Removing Scheduler Tasks ### {#sec-queuing-scheduler-tasks}

<div algorithm="queue a scheduler task">
  To <dfn lt="queue a scheduler task|queuing a scheduler task">queue a scheduler task</dfn>
  on a [=scheduler task queue=] |queue|, which performs a series of steps |steps|,
  given a numeric |enqueue order|, a [=task source=] |source|, and a [=document=] |document|:

  1. Let |task| be a new [=scheduler task=].
  1. Set |task|'s [=scheduler task/enqueue order=] to |enqueue order|.
  1. Set |task|'s <a attribute for="task">steps</a> to |steps|.
  1. Set |task|'s <a attribute for="task">source</a> to |source|.
  1. Set |task|'s <a attribute for="task">document</a> to |document|.
  1. Set |task|'s <a attribute for="task">script evaluation environment settings
     object set</a> to a new empty [=set=].
  1. [=set/Append=] |task| to |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/tasks=].
  1. Return |task|.

  Issue: We should consider refactoring the HTML spec to add a constructor for
  [=/task=]. One problem is we need the new task to be a [=scheduler task=]
  rather than a [=/task=].
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn for="scheduler task queue">remove</dfn> a [=scheduler task=] |task| from
  [=scheduler task queue=] |queue|, [=set/remove=] |task| from |queue|'s
  [=scheduler task queue/tasks=].
</div>

### Scheduling Tasks ### {#sec-scheduler-alg-scheduling-tasks}

<div algorithm="schedule a postTask task">
  To <dfn lt="schedule a postTask task|scheduling a postTask task">schedule a postTask task</dfn>
  for {{Scheduler}} |scheduler| given a {{SchedulerPostTaskCallback}} |callback| and
  {{SchedulerPostTaskOptions}} |options|, run the following steps:

  1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
  1. Let |signal| be |options|["{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}}"] if
     |options|["{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/signal}}"] [=map/exists=], or
     otherwise null.
  1. If |signal| is not null and it is [=AbortSignal/aborted=], then
     [=reject=] |result| with |signal|'s [=AbortSignal/abort reason=] and return
     |result|.
  1. Let |priority| be |options|["{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/priority}}"] if
     |options|["{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/priority}}"] [=map/exists=], or
     otherwise null.
  1. Let |queue| be the result of [=selecting the scheduler task queue=] for
     |scheduler| given |signal| and |priority|.
  1. Let |delay| be |options|["{{SchedulerPostTaskOptions/delay}}"].
  1. If |delay| is greater than 0, then [=run steps after a timeout=] given
     |scheduler|'s [=relevant global object=], "`scheduler-postTask`",
     |delay|, and the following steps:
    1. [=Schedule a task to invoke a callback=] for |scheduler| given |queue|,
       |signal|, |callback|, and |result|.
  1. Otherwise, [=schedule a task to invoke a callback=] for |scheduler| given
     |queue|, |signal|, |callback|, and |result|.
  1. Return |result|.
</div>

Issue: [=Run steps after a timeout=] doesn't necessarily account for suspension;
see [whatwg/html#5925](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5925).

<div algorithm="select the scheduler task queue">
  To <dfn lt="select the scheduler task queue|selecting the scheduler task queue">select the scheduler task queue</dfn>
  for a {{Scheduler}} |scheduler| given an {{AbortSignal}} or null |signal|, and
  a {{TaskPriority}} or null |priority|:

  1. If |priority| is null and |signal| is not null and |signal| [=implements=]
     the {{TaskSignal}} interface, then
    1. If |scheduler|'s [=Scheduler/dynamic priority task queue map=] does not
       [=map/contain=] |signal|, then
      1. Let |queue| be the result of [=creating a scheduler task queue=] given
         |signal|'s [=TaskSignal/priority=].
      1. Set [=Scheduler/dynamic priority task queue map=][|signal|] to |queue|.
      1. [=TaskSignal/Add a priority change algorithm=] to |signal| that
         runs the following steps:
        1. Set |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/priority=] to |signal|'s
           {{TaskSignal/priority}}.
    1. Return [=Scheduler/dynamic priority task queue map=][|signal|].
  1. Otherwise |priority| is used to determine the task queue:
    1. If |priority| is null, set |priority| to "{{TaskPriority/user-visible}}".
    1. If |scheduler|'s [=Scheduler/static priority task queue map=] does not
       [=map/contain=] |priority|, then
      1. Let |queue| be the result of [=creating a scheduler task queue=] given
         |priority|.
      1. Set [=Scheduler/static priority task queue map=][|priority|] to |queue|.
    1. Return [=Scheduler/static priority task queue map=][|priority|].
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn>schedule a task to invoke a callback</dfn> for {{Scheduler}}
  |scheduler| given a [=scheduler task queue=] |queue|, an {{AbortSignal}} or
  null |signal|, a SchedulerPostTaskCallback |callback|, and a promise |result|:

  1. Let |global| be the [=relevant global object=] for |scheduler|.
  1. Let |document| be |global|'s <a attribute for="Window">associated `Document`</a>
     if |global| is a {{Window}} object; otherwise null.
  1. Let |enqueue order| be |scheduler|'s [=Scheduler/next enqueue order=].
  1. Increment |scheduler|'s [=Scheduler/next enqueue order=] by 1.
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=queuing a scheduler task=] on |queue| given
     |enqueue order|, [=the posted task task source=], and |document|, and that
     performs the following steps:
    1. Let |callback result| be the result of [=invoking=] |callback|. If that
       threw an exception, then [=reject=] |result| with that, otherwise resolve
       |result| with |callback result|.
  1. If |signal| is not null, then [=AbortSignal/add|add the following=] abort
     steps to it:
    1. [=scheduler task queue/Remove=] |task| from |queue|.
    1. [=Reject=] |result| with |signal|'s [=AbortSignal/abort reason=].

  Issue: Because this algorithm can be called from [=in parallel=] steps, parts
  of this and other algorithms are racy. Specifically, the
  [=Scheduler/next enqueue order=] should be updated atomically, and accessing
  the [=scheduler task queues=] should occur atomically. The latter also affects
  the event loop task queues (see [this issue](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6475)).

### Selecting the Next Task to Run ### {#sec-scheduler-alg-select-next-task}

<div algorithm="has a runnable task">
  A {{Scheduler}} |scheduler| <dfn lt="has a runnable task|have a runnable task">has a runnable task</dfn>

<div algorithm="get the runnable task queues">
  To <dfn lt="get the runnable task queues|getting the runnable task queues">get the runnable task queues</dfn>

  1. Let |queues| be the result of [=map/get the values|getting the values=] of
     |scheduler|'s [=Scheduler/static priority task queue map=].
  1. [=list/Extend=] |queues| with the result of [=map/get the values|getting the values=]

  1. [=list/Remove=] from |queues| any |queue| such that |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/tasks=]
     do not contain a [=task/runnable=] [=scheduler task=].
  1. Return |queues|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  The result of <dfn>selecting the task queue of the next scheduler task</dfn>
  for {{Scheduler}} |scheduler| is a [=set=] of [=scheduler tasks=] as defined
  by the following steps:

  1. Let |queues| be the result of [=getting the runnable task queues=] for |scheduler|.
  1. If |queues| is [=list/empty=] return null.
  1. [=set/Remove=] from |queues| any |queue| such that |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/priority=]
     is [=TaskPriority/less than=] any other [=set/item=] of |queues|.
  1. Let |queue| be the [=scheduler task queue=] in |queues| whose
     [=scheduler task queue/first runnable task=] is the
     [=scheduler task/older than|oldest=].
     <br/><span class=note>Two tasks cannot have the same age since [=scheduler task/enqueue order=]
     is unique.</span>
  1. Return |queue|'s [=scheduler task queue/tasks=].

  Note: The next task to run is the oldest, highest priority [=task/runnable=]
  [=scheduler task=].
