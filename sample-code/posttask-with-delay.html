      // The API takes an optional argument for 'delay', which is essentially makes
      // postTask act like a prioritized version of setTimeout. The semantics are
      // described in the explainer:
      // https://github.com/WICG/scheduling-apis/blob/master/explainer/prioritized-post-task.md#posting-delayed-tasks

      results.push(scheduler.postTask(() => 'scheduled'));
      results.push(scheduler.postTask(() => 'world,'));

      // All three tasks have the same priority, so if there were no delay,
      // they would run in the order they were posted. But since the first
      // task has a delay, the remaining tasks will finish first.
      //
      // This will append the following to the document:
      //   scheduled
      //   world,
      //   hello!
      // The last word will appear after a 1 second delay.
